# CNNs-for-breast-cancer-detection-and-diagnosis 
The aim of this project is to develop CAD system by mean of CNNs to perform abnormality classification in mammographies. Both from scrach and ImageNet pretrained state-of-the-art CNNs were experimented. The entire project has been implemented by exploiting Keras Deep Learning framework. 

See Report.pdf for the detailed project report with obtained results.
